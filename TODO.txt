TODO: MIGRATION COMMAND FEATURE
================================

HIGH PRIORITY:
- [ ] Add `migrate` command to Core.pm dispatch table
- [ ] Create NVMPL::Migrate module
- [ ] Add migration command to help text

MIGRATION MODULE FEATURES:
- [ ] Detect existing Node.js installations:
      - System package manager (apt, yum, brew)
      - Other version managers (nvm, fnm, asdf)
      - Direct downloads/installations
- [ ] Show migration plan to user
- [ ] Backup current Node.js versions if possible
- [ ] Provide uninstall instructions for existing installations
- [ ] Option to auto-migrate versions from nvm if detected

COMMAND OPTIONS:
- [ ] `nvm-pl migrate check` - Just detect and report
- [ ] `nvm-pl migrate dry-run` - Show what would be migrated
- [ ] `nvm-pl migrate execute` - Actually perform migration
- [ ] `--backup` - Backup existing installations first
- [ ] `--force` - Skip confirmation prompts

DETECTION LOGIC:
- [ ] Check common Node.js installation paths:
      - /usr/bin/node, /usr/local/bin/node
      - ~/.nvm/versions/node/
      - ~/.fnm/node/
      - ~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/
- [ ] Parse version managers' version lists
- [ ] Detect system package manager installations

SAFETY FEATURES:
- [ ] Confirm before any destructive actions
- [ ] Create backup of important Node.js projects
- [ ] Preserve global npm packages if possible
- [ ] Rollback plan if migration fails

POST-MIGRATION:
- [ ] Verify nvm-pl can manage all detected versions
- [ ] Update shell configuration automatically
- [ ] Provide summary of migration results
- [ ] Clean up old installation files

INTEGRATION:
- [ ] Update README.md with migration instructions
- [ ] Add migration tests
- [ ] Handle edge cases (corrupted installations, permission issues)

STRETCH GOALS:
- [ ] Import global npm packages from old installations
- [ ] Convert nvm/fnm version aliases to nvm-pl
- [ ] Batch install all detected versions
- [ ] Smart version conflict resolution
